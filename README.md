# FakeNewsClassifier
CSE 472 : Fake News Classifier

Data folder has all the modified input files required for the project

preprocess.py was used to perform various operations on the dataset like stopwords and removal of null values

val.py was used to calculate the results for accuracy and precision.

knn.py will generate the submission.csv file.

Running both val.py and knn.py will take approximately 5 minutes. So please bear with me.
